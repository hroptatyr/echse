 * Task structure, this is one of the two work horse structures in echse.
 *
 * This structure can capture and represent
 * - a VTODO/VEVENT recurrence (orders)
 * - a VTODO execution
 * - a VTODO/VJOURNAL report
 *
 * Recurring VTODOs or VEVENTs are determined by having a DTSTART
 * in the ical representation whereas executional VTODOs mustn't
 * have that but can of course have a DUE date or a DURATION.
 *
 * Recurring VTODOs can be determined by non-NULL STRM,
 * whereas non-recurring VTODOs have the VTOD_TYP slot set to non-0.
 *
 * Conversely, we serialise recurring VTODOs as VEVENTs and executional
 * VTODOs as VTODO. */
